# Readlog

A book reading tracker built with Flask, SQLite3, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## `CS50x` 2026 Final Project

Video Demo: [Presentation - Readlog](https://youtu.be/E44KyshmvlY)

## Setup

I recommend creating a virtual env before installing the requirements. If you are a Linux user, use the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the requirements (which is just flask, actually):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enter the `src/` directory and run the application:

```
cd src/
python app.py
```


Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
